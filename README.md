# Project_Davidchatbot

A chatbot is a software application that can interact and communicate effectively with people just like humans.
Chatbots use natural language recognition capabilities to recognize what a user is saying, and respond accordingly to their inquiries and requests.
There are two types of chatbots:
## Retrieval based Chatbot
Retrieval-based chatbots work on the principle of graphs or directed flows. The chatbot is trained to provide the best possible response from a database of predefined responses. The responses are based on existing information
Retrieval-based chatbots use techniques like keywords matching, machine learning or deep learning to identify the most appropriate response. Regardless of the technique, these chatbots provide only predefined responses and do not generate new output.
## Generative- Based
Retrieval-based systems are limited to predefined responses. Chatbots that use generative methods can generate new dialogue based on large amounts of conversational training data.
Generative chatbots use a combination of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial learning for multi-step training.
Supervised learning structures a conversation as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Sequence-to-sequence learning maps user inputs to a computer-generated response. However, this type of learning has a tendency to prioritize high-probability responses like “I know”. Supervised learning systems also have trouble including proper nouns into their speech since they appear less in dialogue compared to other words. As a result, supervised learning chatbots sound repetitive and cannot promote stable human conversation.

## In this project, I will create a retrieval based chatbot and deploy it in my website (https://davidelvis.github.io/david/).
With time, I will scale the project and build a Generative Based chatbot.
